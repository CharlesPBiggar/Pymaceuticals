Clinical Trial Data Analysis Using Pandas and Matplotlib within Jupyter Notebook
-------------------------

<b> Project Discription </b>: Using clinical trial data on 250 mice that were treated with a 
variety of drug regimes over 45 days analyze the tumor volume changes, metastasis 
occurence, survival rate and percent change in tumor size to see how the four main 
treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare in effectiveness.

-------------------------
Analyzed Trends: <br/>
1)Capomulin was the only analyzed drug to show a decrease in tumor size over the 
course of treatment, with an average percent change of -19.5%.<br/>
2)While Capomulin had a decrease of tumor growth over time it still had an increase 
in metastases over the course of treatment.<br/>
3)Capomulin was the only analyzed drug to have a surival rate of >80%, all other 
analyzed drugs had a survival rate of <50%<br/>
